# Python Api Challenge
# Do you want to know the best cities and hotels to visit to go fishing? This code answers your questions about it.

Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. To accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a representative model of weather across world cities.

Create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

• Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
• Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
• Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
• Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

Linear regression on each relationship, only this time separating them into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude):

• Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
• Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
• Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
• Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
• Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
• Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
• Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
• Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
